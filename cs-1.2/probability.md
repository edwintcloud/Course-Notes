# Probability

### Axioms

* 0 &lt;= P\(A\) &lt;= 1
* P\(True\) = 1 and P\(False\) = 0
* P\(A or B\) = P\(A\) + P\(B\) - P\(A and B\)

### Discreet Probability

* Deals with events that occur in countable sample spaces
* eg. coins, dice, cards, random walks

### Uniform Distribution

* A known finite number of outcome are equally likely to occur
* Each of n values has probability 1/n

#### Word Frequencies

* **Tokens -** occurrences of words \(frequency\)
* **Types -** distinct words \(unique\_words\)
