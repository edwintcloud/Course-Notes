# Arrays and Linked Lists

### Arrays

* contiguous piece of memory
* same size storage space at each index
* static- memory allocated once, size can't change
* dynamic- new memory allocated, array copied to grow
* Runtime computation: O\(1\)
* To insert of delete element: O\(n\)
* Delete Element or insert at the end: O\(1\)

### Linked List

* not contiguous piece of memory
* differing size storage space at each index
* dynamic
* no need to copy the whole thing like an array
