# Questions



* What are the key features of the application? Are these clearly separated into their own files, classes, and/or modules? Creating a histogram, reading a file into a list, generating a random weighted word, generating a sentence from random weighted words, cleaning up list of word in file. Yes
* Are the names of files, modules, functions, and variables appropriate and accurate? Would a new programmer be able to understand the names without too much contextual knowledge? Yes, absolutely
* What are the scopes of variables and are they appropriate for their use case? If there are global variables, why are they needed? Instance variables inside dictogram and listogram class, and function scope variables otherwise. No global variables as they are unnecessary.
* Are the functions small and clearly specified, with as few side effects as possible? Yes
* Are there functions that could be better organized in an Object-Oriented Programming style by defining them as methods of a class? Not that I can immediately foresee
* Can files be used as [both modules and as scripts](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html#executing-modules-as-scripts)? Certainly
* Do modules all depend on each other or can they be used independently? Can be used independently.
