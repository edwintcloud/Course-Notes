# File Operations

* repr\(line\) prints exact representation of the file line eg. for if statement comparison
* readLines\(\) after open
* strip\(\) removes new line characters \(also lstrip\(\) and rstrip\(\)\)
* split\(\) splits at character
* open\(\) to open file
* Most efficient to open entire file into a buffer once then modify or do operations
