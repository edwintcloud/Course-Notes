### Domain: Transportation and Cities

* Tourist App to show local inspired suggestion using GoogleMaps API
* Scavenger Hunt app - Find Landmarks/Hidden Objects and take pictures to explore an area. Data gathered could also be used for statistics
* Roadtrip App for multiple vehicles to keep all vehicles aware of each other's location on a map \(group tracking\)

### Personal Idea: Transportation and Cities

* App that uses the Google Map API to find gas prices along a route and determines when is the best time to stop for gas. Calculate based off miles per tank, miles to gas stations, and price per gallon. Notification with option to navigate.
